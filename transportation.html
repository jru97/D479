        <h2>Getting to Taniti</h2>

        <div class="text-block left">
            Reaching the island of Taniti is easy and scenic, with a few travel options to suit your style. 
            Most visitors arrive by small jet airplanes, which land at Taniti’s modern airport that accommodates 
            regional flights from nearby islands and mainland hubs. Flights offer stunning aerial views of the 
            island’s lush landscape and volcanic terrain.
            <br><br>
            For a more leisurely arrival, cruise ships also make regular stops at Taniti, docking near Merriton 
            Landing, where passengers can step off right into the heart of the island’s vibrant culture and coastal 
            beauty. Whether you fly in or sail up, getting to Taniti is just the beginning of the adventure.

                <div class="text-block">
                    For travelers staying in or around Merriton Landing, the island’s public bus system is a 
                    reliable and cost-effective way to get around. Public buses serve the city daily, running 
                    from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m., making it easy to get to shops, restaurants, and major attractions 
                    without the need for a car. Buses are clean, efficient, and frequented by both locals and 
                    tourists, offering a glimpse into everyday island life.

                <div class="text-block">
                    While public buses are limited to Merriton Landing, private bus services connect visitors to 
                    the rest of the island. These are ideal for reaching more remote destinations like the rainforest 
                    trails, the volcanic slopes of Mount Tanoa, or the tranquil shores of Yellow Leaf Bay. Schedules 
                    can vary by route and season, so checking ahead with your hotel or local information centers is 
                    recommended.

                    Taxis are readily available in Merriton Landing and can be a convenient option for short trips, especially if you’re traveling with luggage or prefer door-to-door service. Fares are generally affordable, and most drivers are knowledgeable about the island’s landmarks and can offer tips and suggestions along the way.

                <div class="text-block">
                    If you prefer to explore the island at your own pace, rental cars are available near the airport through a locally run rental agency. Having a car is especially helpful if you plan to visit more secluded areas or travel between towns. Roads are generally well maintained, though mountainous areas near Mount Tanoa may require careful driving.

                    For the eco-conscious traveler or those looking for a more active way to explore, bike rentals are available from several vendors across the island. Each rental includes a helmet — <strong>required by law</strong> — and often comes with a map of suggested bike routes. Biking is a particularly pleasant way to explore the coastlines and local villages, offering up-close views of the island’s stunning scenery.
